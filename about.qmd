### About this site

This site is used for my accomplishments and projects throughout my masters degree.

# M.S.

My research focuses on various aspects of data science, including the creation of databases and applications, as well as methods for analyzing and visualizing data to extract meaningful insights.

Fall 2025: I am learning how to apply programming to social science automation, including GIS object-based model design and the use of programming languages such as Python for project development. I work with data structures, algorithms, user-interface design, and database management, with an emphasis on rapid application development through hands-on projects. I will design and implement independent projects that allow me to synthesize programming concepts, customize applications, and evaluate methods for processing geospatial data at the object level while aligning programming with my research agenda.

I am also learning how to design and critique data visualizations, from theoretical foundations such as the grammar of graphics, perception, and cognition to AI-assisted analysis and communication. I program visualizations for both exploration and storytelling, and I will prototype, evaluate, and iterate them with attention to effectiveness, accuracy, ethics, and reproducibility. I build interactive graphics, dashboards, and explorable explanations that communicate insights with ethical guardrails.

### Past Semesters

Spring 2025: I worked on research analysis of [Positive Emotions Across Races](Positive_Emotions_Across_Races.pdf) in my independent study, exploring past literature and data sets. I am using North Texas Quality of Life data to use descriptive statistics and correlational analysis to understand patterns and relationships related to race and positive emotions. The hopes is to create a research paper incorporating regression analysis. In econometrics, I studied regression analysis on the interpretation of Ordinary Least Squares, times series and instrument variables with using STATA. I was nominated for Outstanding Graduate Student.

Fall 2024: My research consisted of designing research, using different methods to obtain experimental or observational data and understanding regression models and how to visual the data through charts or spatially. In [Methods of Data Collection and Production](EPPS6302.html), I am worked with 3 people on a mixed method research on fast fast and the impact of consumers through social media influencers. We are used web scarping and survey to do this research. In Research Design, I worked with 2 people on understanding how to design an experiments. We researched pro-climate change information and shifting public consensus. This project consisted of creating a literature review, creating a methodology with directional hypotheses and upholding experimental design. Additionally, we designed a shorter project where we interviewed people in person to understand UTD student's course load and stress levels. We used some questions from the Perceived Stress Scale and created additional question to know their course load. In Research Design, I gained experience in hypothesis testing, survey design and research methodology.

Spring 2024: In [Information Management](EPPS6354.html), I learned how to design a database using SQL and NoSQL and create an application using RStudio. In methods of qualitative research, I designed research project understanding social benefits of immigrants in host country assimilation in the corporate world. This project consisted of taking field notes, interviewing participants and understanding the IRB process. We hoped this project would receive enough participants to publish research but unfortunately, we did not.

# Undergraduate Studies

With BS in Sociology, I obtained a concentration in health and medicine. I looked at disparities among healthcare access through race, gender and income level. I focused a lot of studies towards drug abuse and drug addiction and looked at policies analyses of recidivism for drug incarcerations.

I conducted research studies at the Social Processes Lab at the University of Houston. The lab focused their studies on how individuals are impacted by social relationships specifically with close relationships.
