To find the finished project, look at the EPPS6354 tab. In methods of qualitative research, I designed research project understanding social benefits of immigrants in host country assimilation in the corporate world. This project consisted of taking field notes, interviewing participants and understanding the IRB process. We hoped this project would receive enough participants to publish research but unfortunately, we did not.\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Studies\nWith BS in Sociology, I obtained a concentration in health and medicine. I looked at disparities among healthcare access through race, gender and income level. I focused a lot of studies towards drug abuse and drug addition and looked at policies analyses of recidivism for drug incarcerations. With BS in Sociology, I obtained a concentration in health and medicine.\nI conducted research studies at the Social Processes Lab at the University of Houston. The lab focused their studies on how individuals are impacted by social relationships specifically with close relationships.\nSocial Processes Lab"
