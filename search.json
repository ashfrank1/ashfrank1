    "text": "About this site\nThis site is used for my accomplishments and projects throughout my masters degree.\n\n\nM.S.\nMy research focuses on various aspects of data science, including the creation of databases and applications, as well as methods for analyzing and visualizing data to extract meaningful insights.\nFall 2025: I am learning how to apply programming to social science automation, including GIS object-based model design and the use of programming languages such as Python for project development. I work with data structures, algorithms, user-interface design, and database management, with an emphasis on rapid application development through hands-on projects. I will design and implement independent projects that allow me to synthesize programming concepts, customize applications, and evaluate methods for processing geospatial data at the object level while aligning programming with my research agenda.\nI am also learning how to design and critique data visualizations, from theoretical foundations such as the grammar of graphics, perception, and cognition to AI-assisted analysis and communication. I program visualizations for both exploration and storytelling, and I will prototype, evaluate, and iterate them with attention to effectiveness, accuracy, ethics, and reproducibility. I build interactive graphics, dashboards, and explorable explanations that communicate insights with ethical guardrails.\n\nPast Semesters\nSpring 2025: I worked on research analysis of Positive Emotions Across Races in my independent study, exploring past literature and data sets. I am using North Texas Quality of Life data to use descriptive statistics and correlational analysis to understand patterns and relationships related to race and positive emotions. The hopes is to create a research paper incorporating regression analysis. In econometrics, I studied regression analysis on the interpretation of Ordinary Least Squares, times series and instrument variables with using STATA. I was nominated for Outstanding Graduate Student.\nFall 2024: My research consisted of designing research, using different methods to obtain experimental or observational data and understanding regression models and how to visual the data through charts or spatially. In Methods of Data Collection and Production, I am worked with 3 people on a mixed method research on fast fast and the impact of consumers through social media influencers. We are used web scarping and survey to do this research. In Research Design, I worked with 2 people on understanding how to design an experiments. We researched pro-climate change information and shifting public consensus. This project consisted of creating a literature review, creating a methodology with directional hypotheses and upholding experimental design. Additionally, we designed a shorter project where we interviewed people in person to understand UTD student’s course load and stress levels. We used some questions from the Perceived Stress Scale and created additional question to know their course load. In Research Design, I gained experience in hypothesis testing, survey design and research methodology.\nSpring 2024: In Information Management, I learned how to design a database using SQL and NoSQL and create an application using RStudio. In methods of qualitative research, I designed research project understanding social benefits of immigrants in host country assimilation in the corporate world. This project consisted of taking field notes, interviewing participants and understanding the IRB process. We hoped this project would receive enough participants to publish research but unfortunately, we did not.\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Studies\nWith BS in Sociology, I obtained a concentration in health and medicine. I looked at disparities among healthcare access through race, gender and income level. I focused a lot of studies towards drug abuse and drug addiction and looked at policies analyses of recidivism for drug incarcerations.\nI conducted research studies at the Social Processes Lab at the University of Houston. The lab focused their studies on how individuals are impacted by social relationships specifically with close relationships.\nSocial Processes Lab"

    "text": "Methods of Data Collection and Production\n\nAssignment 2:\n\nR-package Google trends data vs. downloaded data on Google trends.\nDifferences: Downloaded Google trends data is easier for a quick look, and gives daily or weekly intervals. It is less adjustable with the time frame. “gtrendsR” package allows for more in-depth parameters of the search with time intervals and interest over time. The package allows for in-depth research of the data and data manipulation.\n\n\nAssignment 3:\nText Analysis\n\nAnalyze Biden-Xi Summit data: The key terms in the topic are china, america, Biden, Xijinping suggesting a focus on China-U.S. relations. Fentanyl and Corona-virus were also key health issues during this discussion surrounding China and U.S. trade. There is a cluster of topics surrounding human rights, uyghurgenocide, Tibetans and uyghurs. This cluster divides from Biden but contains central issues surrounding Tibetans and Xi for human rights. Taiwan, USA, US and CCP are peripheral nodes. Taiwan comes from China giving relevance to U.S.-China relations. CPP divides from Xijinping, given its location, it means the topic is not a dominant topic surrounding the US-China discussion.\n\nAnalyze U.S. presidential inaugural speeches: The use of “American” throughout the speeches is a fairly common used word but have varying distributions. Clinton, Trump and Biden have dense clusters of the usage of the word towards the end of their speech. This could be in part to address a focus on national rhetoric. The use of the word “Citizens” is mostly used as an address to people in the beginning of speeches indicated by the first mark towards the beginning of most of the speeches. In earlier speeches, the use of the word is less prominent, showing a shift in addressing people as active participants in government. The use of “freedom” is used fairly frequently. Bush and Reagan show heavy usage, indicating their political ideologies and focus on liberty during their presidency. In more recent speeches, Obama, Trump and Biden, use the word less frequently, showing a shift in the political focus.\nWhat is Wordfish? Wordfish is a Poisson scaling model of one-dimensional document positions. It allows for scaling documents without the need for reference scores/texts and uses unsupervised text scaling methods. It estimates the positions of documents based on observed word frequencies.\n\n\nAssignment 4:\nWeb Scraping\nUsing rvest to scrape Wikipedia page of foreign reserve data. This is how I modified the code to scrape the second table in the wiki page.\n#scrape second table assignment 4\n\nurl &lt;- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_foreign-exchange_reserves'\n#Reading the HTML code from the Wiki website\nwikiforreserve &lt;- read_html(url)\nclass(wikiforreserve)\n\ncurrencyex &lt;- wikiforreserve %&gt;%\n  html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id=\"mw-content-text\"]/div[1]/table[2]') %&gt;%\n  html_table()\nclass(currencyex) # Why the first column is not scrapped?\ncurre &lt;- currencyex [[1]][,c(1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)]\nnames(curre) &lt;- c(\"Quarter\", \"USD\", \"EUR\", \"JPY\",\"GBP\", \"CAD\",\"RMB\", \"AUD\", \"CHF\", \"OtherCurrencies\", \"UnallocatedReserves\", \"Total\")\nwrite.csv(curre, \"currencycomp.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\nThe scraped data has some data inconsistency with how it is pulled from the URL. The table column names has be renamed or sometimes re-done to correct class. With the downloading from GovInfo, there has been delays with how you pull to avoid being flagged for suspicion. This makes the process slower, especially when downloading large data sets. With the Wikipedia data, the best way to improve is improving data type conversation.\n\n\nAssignment 5:\nYouTube API data on CNN channel\n\nThis a word cloud of the most commented words on CNN’s YouTube videos. There is frequent uses of polarized words such as “joke” and “garbage” indicating negative opinions regarding the topics. There are mentions of “Trump”, “Harris” and “Biden” showing prominent discussion on these political figures during the election, specifically with the words, “vote” and “president”. There is strong viewer engagement and emotional responses to CNN’s content.\n\nThis shows CNN’s video likes. The Video ID’s are provided but not the title so it is harder to infer specific topics and their engagement to audiences. However, we can still tell there is engagement in their videos through their likes and the audience stays interested. The high like count suggests that the content resonates with the viewers and may align with the viewer’s beliefs. Given the polarized comments, some videos may show public interest on the covered topics.\n\nThe peaks show an increased of published videos during the time frame. October 28 has a peak in publishing which might correlate with breaking news or significant political events. Lower publishing numbers can reflect a period with fewer newsworthy events or when CNN focuses on fewer in-depth reports. With the spikes, the higher viewer demand during news cycle. CNN increases their content output to cover stories or maintain viewer interest, which can correlate with publishing frequency.\n\n\nFinal Project:\nFinal Project\nFinal Presentation\n\n\nResources:\nhttps://rvest.tidyverse.org/ : scraping web data through R\nhttps://www.tidytextmining.com/ : text mining with R\nhttps://tutorials.quanteda.io/introduction/ : text analysis with R, Text data\nhttps://egap.org/methods-guides/"

Consensus approaches  can minimize (or eliminate) invalidation of information. The use of consensus can yield a potent tool for research.\n\n\nPublic and Non-Profit Managment Conference - April 25th - 2025\nI attended the 9th Annual PNM conference in innovation in public and nonprofit management.

But let’s be clear: You can’t gut the funding without gutting the services.\nIn Texas, that means fewer doctors, less care and real harm to people already struggling. One major target is a legal funding mechanism used by almost every state: provider taxes that help unlock federal Medicaid dollars. If Congress lowers the cap on these taxes, Texas could lose nearly $5 billion in care. That’s not fraud reduction; that’s cutting care.\nWe need leaders who will protect our most vulnerable, not quietly dismantle the system they rely on. Call your representative today and urge them to oppose these harmful Medicaid cuts. Texans can’t afford to lose the care they depend on.\nAshleigh M. Frank, North Dallas\n\n\nSNAP LTE\nIn Dallas Morning News: Sunday May 18th, 2025\nPrioritize food policies\nRe: “Texas leads nation in hunger — Rising prices for necessities outpace D-FW family budgets,” Thursday news story.\nAs a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas, I often plan my meals around the limited food I receive from the campus pantry, supported by the North Texas Food Bank. Despite working and budgeting, I can’t always afford enough food, and I know I’m not alone. According to UTD’s 2023 Your Needs Survey, 25.8% of students ate less than they should because they couldn’t afford to buy more food. But food insecurity goes beyond campus. Many families today are struggling with rising grocery costs and other essential expenses. No one should have to choose between basic needs. Hunger affects our communities, our workforce and our future. Congress has the opportunity to address this in the next Farm Bill by strengthening SNAP benefits and making them more accessible. We must prioritize policies that ensure every person, student, worker, parent or elder has reliable access to nutritious food. I urge readers to contact their congressional members to prioritize this urgent issue and protect the health and well-being of all Texans.\nAshleigh M. Frank, Dallas"

    "text": "Assignment 1\n\nAnscombe’s (1973) paper highlights how datasets with nearly identical summary statistics (mean, variance, correlation, regression line) can nonetheless reveal strikingly different patterns when graphed. The four models demonstrate reliance on numerical measures alone can obscure key features such as non-linearity, outliers, and unusual data structures. The main lesson is the essential role of visualization in statistical analysis. Visualization of the models or data can improve quantitative summaries. A practical solution is to incorporate exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, such as scatterplots, boxplots, and residual plots, early in research to detect anomalies before modeling. Additionally, modern extensions like interactive visualizations and diagnostic checks can further safeguard against misleading interpretations, ensuring that conclusions rest on both robust statistics and an accurate understanding of the underlying data.\n\n\nThis chart from a UNICEF–Gallup survey shows what young people (ages 15–24) in 21 countries believe is the most important factor in determining success. The side-by-side horizontal bar charts are helpful for seeing within-country differences, but the design makes cross-country comparisons harder than necessary. Because the categories are split into four separate panels, the viewer has to scan back and forth across columns rather than directly comparing values on a single axis. The sorting of countries by income per capita adds context, but introduces a visual bias. Readers may infer causal relationships between national wealth and values without the chart explicitly addressing them. A clearer alternative would be to combine responses into a grouped or stacked bar chart, aligning all categories for each country in one view. Small multiples with consistent scales would make it easier to compare how emphasis on education, hard work, or family wealth varies across regions. Simplifying the layout would improve readability and strengthen the chart’s ability to communicate cultural differences in beliefs about success.\nJournalism in the Age of Data"
